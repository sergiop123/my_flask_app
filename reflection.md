# AI usage reflection
For this project, we utilized ChatGPT 5 in order to test and debug this app and add further functionality. Using this, we were able to accelerate learning, clarify unclear concepts, and generate working prototypes. We used AI to:
- Help design and structure the Flask app
- Assist in writing and optimizing python functions for data analysis
- Suggesting improvements such as Plotly in order to better visualize our data
- Debug errors that were unclear or above our expertise
- We were able to enhance the user experience and make it more intuitive by:
    - Creating a Dashboard with KPIs
    - Monthly sales trends and profit analysis
    - Geo-map using Plotly
    - Quality of life features (Dark mode toggle), progress spinner, and date range filter
    - Formatting output as currency and improved chart labeling
# How we verified and modified AI code
- We tested all flask functions locally to make sure that charts and filters worked correctly
- Adjusted the data column names and query functions to match the Superstore.csv
- Added explanatory comments for readability
# What we learned
Using AI, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of how Flask integrates frontend and backend to produce a complete web application. We also gained experience with prompt engineering and learned how to better prompt AI in order to solve our problems more efficiently and accurately. We are now more confident in debugging and customizing code rather than just copying and pasting. After many cycles of debugging, we have learned the importance of reviewing AI generated code and being able to identify best practices and accuracy.
